Files included: stack_queue7.c, stackqueue7.h, hw7.c, hw7.h
------
The stack_queue7.c functions calculate the amount of pay from tips that 
an employee at a resturant receives from inputted tips and hours worked.

The hw7.c functions read from a file to create a linked list of airline customers
and will output all passengers on a given flight to both the terminal and a file.

The test.c file is not included, as it is simply used as an example .c file 
to show compilation of the included functions.

------

--Example 1 (running stack_queue7.c):
gcc test.c stack_queue7.c -o prog
