Problem 1:
1) False
    get_ride() and add_line() don't have to be in the same class, however it is likely they are. get_ride() has to be a function from the amusement_park class, but add_line() could possibly be in a Ride class.
2) False
    We can only assume it has r1 and r2, which is 2, not 3.
3) True
    string needs std:: if namespace is not used.
4) False
    get_ride() must be public as it is used outside of the class.
5) False - True
    We can assume that the functions is a part of the amusement_park class, but we can't be sure. It could be a part of another class.
6) False
    the 2 constructors used for amusement_park are a1 and a2. There isn't a duplicate of either with different parameters.
7) True
    We can tell it returns an int as it is set to int n in an instance of its use.
8) True
    Since we can see a1 and a2 are objects of amusement_park, and get_ride() is used on them, then get_ride() must be in the amusement_park class.
9) False
    We can assume it may be a object ride, but we can't tell from the code alone.
10) False - True
    There are 3 classes used and 4 objects created.

Problem 2:
1) Creating and initializing an object
2) Creating an object
3) Creating and initializing a variable (by storing a function return value)
4) Creating and initializing a variable (by hardcoding)
5) Assigning a value to a variable (by storing a function return value)
